## Data subsets
Once the alignments are generated for each data subset, we can run `MCMCtree`. 

The files that you will need to generate the plots that you see in this directory 
can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ud47xdhg9dbfoid/MCMCtree_data_subsets.zip?dl=0).
Just unzip this file here, then open the R script inside the [`scripts`](/01_SeqBayes_S1/00_Gene_filtering/data_subsets/scripts)
directory, follow the instructions in the comments, and you will be able to generate the same plots that are 
already found in this directory.
