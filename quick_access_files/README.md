# Quick access to input files used in our study

If you have gone through our step-by-step tutorial and followed the instructions in the various `README.md` files, you will have seen that we have included many links to compressed files that you can download with all our input and output files we used/generated as part of our study ([√Ålvarez-Carretero et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04341-1)). While our output files (and some input files such as large alignments) are too big to host in a GitHub repository, we have created this new section so that you can quickly access  control files, tree files, `in.BV` files, and other input/output files which size is less than 100Mb that we used when running PAML programs `BASEML` and `MCMCtree`. You can access these resources via the following links:

* [Resources used/generated during the first part of the Bayesian Sequential Subtree approach: first data subset and the backbone tree](00_SeqBayes_S1/README.md)
* [Resources used/generated during the second part of the Bayesian Sequential Subtree approach: second data subset and subtrees](01_SeqBayes_S2/README.md)

In addition, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:sandra.ac93@gmail.com"><b>contact me</b></a> if you think there are other input/output files (size limit 100Mb) that you would like to quickly access on this GitHub repository!
