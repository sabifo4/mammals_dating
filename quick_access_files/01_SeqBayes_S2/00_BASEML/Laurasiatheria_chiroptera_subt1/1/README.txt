When transferring the data from our HPC cluster, the `rst2` output file
for this analysis was not retrieved because the analysis did not finish
within the time jobs were allowed to run (i.e., 10 days). 
We did not use this concatenated alignment for subsequent
analysis, and thus we did not pursue further to obtain the branch lengths,
Hessian, and gradient for this concatenated alignment file.
The `tmp*` files can be found inside the `prepare_baseml_files` directory
when decompressing the file you can download from our Dropbox archive:
`Laurasiatheria_chiroptera_subt1/1/prepare_baseml_files`
