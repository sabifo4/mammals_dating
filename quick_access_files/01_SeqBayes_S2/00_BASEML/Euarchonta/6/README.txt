When transferring the data from our HPC cluster, the `rst2` output file
for this analysis was not retrieved perhaps due to issues with 
soft-linking. If you download the compressed file from our Dropbox archive
you will not find an `rst2` file. Nevertheless, given that the `rst2` file
we generated in directory `7` with the concatenated `rst2` files for each
directory `2` to `6`, we have been able to retrieve the individual block
for the `rst2` file, which is the file you can access in this directory.
