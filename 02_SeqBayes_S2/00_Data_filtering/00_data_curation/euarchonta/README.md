## Curated alignment 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final alignments 
before running `BASEML` and `MCMCtree` with this data subset
(available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/djlncitmsehsyap/SeqBayesS2_Raln_euarchonta.zip?dl=0))
have been explained [here](/02_SeqBayes_S2/00_Data_filtering/00_data_curation/euarchonta/filter_aln).
Just follow the steps in the order given and you will be able to reproduce our results.
