# Rodentia ctenohystrica

## Curated alignment 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final alignments 
before running `BASEML` and `MCMCtree` with this data subset
(available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9cjmclt4q2h9p3n/SeqBayesS2_Raln_ctenohystrica_ALLFILTERS.zip?dl=0))
have been explained [here](https://github.com/sabifo4/mammals_dating/tree/main/02_SeqBayes_S2/00_Data_filtering/00_data_curation/rodentia_ctenohystrica/filter_aln).
Please note that the zip file provided above includes other directories with the alignments generated 
in previous filtering steps. Those found in the main directory are the alignments generated at 
the end of all the filtering steps. Please just follow the steps in the order given and you will be able
to reproduce our results. 

## Curated tree 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final tree alignments 
can be found [here](https://github.com/sabifo4/mammals_dating/tree/main/02_SeqBayes_S2/00_Data_filtering/00_data_curation/rodentia_ctenohystrica/filter_tree).
