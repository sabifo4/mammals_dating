# Rodentia ctenohystrica

## Curated alignment 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final alignments 
before running `BASEML` and `MCMCtree` with this data subset
(available [here]())
have been explained [here](https://github.com/sabifo4/mammals_dating/tree/main/02_SeqBayes_S2/00_Data_filtering/00_data_curation/rodentia_ctenohystrica/filter_aln).
Just follow the steps in the order given and you will be able to reproduce our results. 

## Curated tree 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final tree alignments 
can be found [here](https://github.com/sabifo4/mammals_dating/tree/main/02_SeqBayes_S2/00_Data_filtering/00_data_curation/rodentia_ctenohystrica/filter_tree).
