# Rodentia the rest

## Curated alignment 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final alignments 
before running `BASEML` and `MCMCtree` with this data subset
(download the data alignments before proceeding with further partitioning
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bo4shh56jrlswwi/SeqBayesS2_Raln_rodentia_therest.zip?dl=0),
download the alignments for data subset 1 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5cxvn2fvqdevti8/SeqBayesS2_Raln_rod_subt1.zip?dl=0),
and download the alignments data subset 2 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j0my2nq02al4g8/SeqBayesS2_Raln_rod_subt2.zip?dl=0))
have been explained [here](filter_aln).
Just follow the steps in the order given and you will be able to reproduce our results. You will also find all 
the details about the need of further partitioning this data set into two data subsets.

## Curated tree 
All the details about the procedure followed to generate the final tree alignments 
can be found [here](filter_tree).
