# The Mammal Tree of Life 
Here, you can find the final mammal Tree of Life after we grafted the different 
data subsets onto the backbone tree (i.e., combining the results from the first step 
of the sequential Bayesian dating approach with the those obtained during the 
second step).

An explanation for each file can be found below:   

  * [4705sp.tree](4705sp.tree): this is the final mammal timetree in NEXUS format. It includes the confidence intervals (CIs) for the
  estimated mean divergence times.   
  * [4705sp_mean.nwk](4705sp_mean.nwk): this is the final mammal timetree in newick format. The CIs are not included here.     
  * [4705sp_ci025.nexus](4705sp_ci025.nexus): this is a mammal timetree in NEXUS format which mean divergence times correspond to the minimum
  ages that were estimated in the 2.5% CIs included in the final mammal timetree. The CIs
  estimated with the final mammal timetree have also been included.   
  * [4705sp_ci025.nwk](4705sp_ci025.nwk): this is a mammal timetree in newick format which mean divergence times correspond to the minimum
  ages that were estimated in the 2.5% CIs included in the final mammal timetree. CIs are not included.   
  * [4705sp_ci975.nexus](4705sp_ci975.nexus): this is a mammal timetree in NEXUS format which mean divergence times correspond to the maximum
  ages that were estimated in the 97.5% CIs included in the final mammal timetree. The CIs
  estimated with the final mammal timetree have also been included.   
  * [4705sp_ci975.nwk](4705sp_ci975.nwk): this is a mammal timetree in newick format which mean divergence times correspond to the minimum
  ages that were estimated in the 97.5% CIs included in the final mammal timetree. The CIs
  estimated with the final mammal timetree have also been included.   
  * [4705sp_names.txt](4705sp_names.txt): this file contains a list of the 4,705 mammal species included in the final mammal timetree.
