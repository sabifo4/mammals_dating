# Extra analyses

[Here](00_Data_filtering)
you will find a detailed description of the steps we followed to generate the data alignments we 
needed for these extra analyses. 

[Here](03_Analyses) 
you will find the R script
[Compare_divtimes_72spVS4705sp.R](03_Analyses/Compare_divtimes_72spVS4705sp.R)
and the output files this script generates, which summarise the divergence 
times estimated when using the data subsets used in this extra analysis. The R script is extensively 
document, so please open it in RStudio to reproduce the results we report here. Please note that you will 
need to download some of the data that were generated during the Bayesian sequential-subtree 
analysis. Please follow the corresponding tutorials in this GitHub repository, where you will find 
the links to download this data and save it in the same file architecture that you need to have 
to run the [R script](03_Analyses/Compare_divtimes_72spVS4705sp.R).
